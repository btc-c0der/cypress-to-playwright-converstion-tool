    "introduction": """
Playwright's architecture is fundamentally a decoupled client-server model, a design choice that serves as the bedrock for its language agnosticism, cross-browser consistency, and alignment with modern web application structures. This paradigm is not merely an implementation detail but the central pillar enabling the framework's most powerful capabilities.

**The Fundamental Components: Client and Server**

The architecture comprises two primary components:

1. **The Client**: The environment where developers write test scripts using Playwright's language-specific APIs. These bindings are available for JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET.

2. **The Playwright Server**: A Node.js process that functions as the central nervous system. It acts as an intermediary, receiving commands from the client, translating them into browser instructions, and managing the lifecycle of all browser instances.
